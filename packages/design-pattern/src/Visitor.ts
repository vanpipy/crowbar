/**
 * The visitor pattern is not a method to show the way to solve a problem,
 * it is a solution to solve a problem indeed.
 *
 * A visitor includes lots of things which has a same attribute, like exporting file or others.
 *
 * So the [picture](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/visitor/visitor.png) is really,
 * really precise description.
 *
 * But for node, a visitor can work more effective. The decorator is the good partner maybe?.
 *
 * Using the decorator changes the pattern. A visitor is just a visitor and solves a problem indeed.
