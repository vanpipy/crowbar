/**
 * [Mediator Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)
 *
 * There is an important definition of the mediator that:
 * > Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between
 * > objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to
 * > collaborate only via a mediator object.
 *
 * means a mediator changes the relations between the objects, it is very simple, useful, and
 * not easy to find an example when coding cause its simple. The appearance is easy to confuse
 * and blind us, the mediator pattern is a good way to think and review the passed.
 *
 * For this, the mediator pattern is not a immutable structure, its structure depends the
 * environment used.
 *
 * So coding a mediator without real stuff like building a house but no one in.
